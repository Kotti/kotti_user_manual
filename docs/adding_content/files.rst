Adding Files
============

Files are normal files that you create store on your computer, but for one
reason or another, wish to post on your website. One common need is to post PDF
files, perhaps for a newsletter or brochure. Another common need is to post
word processor or spreadsheet files to share. You don't edit these files with
Kotti, but you can add them anywhere, and you can link to them from documents.

Images are not Files, per se, in the context of Kotti. They have their own
content type.
