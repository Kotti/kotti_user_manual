View Selection
==============

The default view for a content item is set by the system for Document, Image,
and File, and by custom add-on software for custom types. If a content item
contains other items, a list of the items can be seen by the Contents view,
and if a list-style view is preferred on a permanent basis for the item, the
default view can be reset to ``Folder View`` via the Actions menu:
