Searching by Keywords
---------------------

The general site search is always available for standard keywords searching,
which works as you probably expect that it should. The word or phrase is
searched in titles, description, and in the body text, and matching content
items are then presented in a search results list.

For the fruit stand website, we should expect to find a number of content items
when we search for a general word like "fruit" and we do:

Searching by Clicking on a Tag
------------------------------

In the normal view for a content item, if you click a tag, the website will be
searched for items that have been tagged with the clicked tag. Here we have
visited the page for pineapple, and we see that it has been tagged with the
"Tropical" tag, for the tropical fruit category.

We know that several other fruits were also tagged with "Tropical," such as
kiwi and avocado. When we click the "Tropical" tag on the pineapple view above, 
a search is done to find items sharing the "Tropical" tag:

Searching Tags in General Search
--------------------------------

You can also find content with certain tags by entering search terms into the
general search field in the top toolbar of the site. If a tag is titled
'British cars', a search for either 'British cars' exactly, 'British', or
'cars' will find any items with the tag.

We know that, as for the "Tropical" tag, we expect to find multiple results
when we do a general search on "Pit" and we do:

.. Image:: ../images/search_results_for_pit.png

.. Note:: Clicking on a tag is a tag-centric, single-tag search. General search
          will perhaps find more results, because it compares all of these for
          the search query text: title, description, body text, and tags.
