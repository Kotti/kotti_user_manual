Breadcrumbs
===========

Once you have added several documents, perhaps following an outline to build a
nested structure of documents, Kotti will handle linking the documents together
in its menu and breadcrumbs system.

You see the path to the current document in the breadcrumbs display above the
title:

Toolbar
=======

You see the main sections displayed across the top, in the toolbar, with
navigation and searchbox:

Navigate View
=============

For logged-in users, there is a main "Navigate" view that shows an outline for
the entire site, showing content items as they are stored within the site
structure.

Each item in the outline has an "Edit" icon, which offers a quick way to find
and edit content items:
