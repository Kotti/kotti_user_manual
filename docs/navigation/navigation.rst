Breadcrumbs
===========

Once you have added several documents, perhaps following an outline to build a
nested structure of documents, Kotti will handle linking the documents together
in its navigation system, which you see as the menu system, perhaps up top in
the header area, or in an indented tree display on the left or right, depending
on the design of your website. There is also a "breadcrumbs" style display in
the default Kotti system, that shows  "You are here" path from the root of the
site to a specific location in the site:

Toolbar
=======

You see the main sections displayed across the top, in the toolbar, with
navigation and searchbox:

Navigate View
=============

For logged-in users, there is a main "Navigate" view that shows an outline for
the entire site, showing content items as they are stored within the site
structure.

Each item in the outline has an "Edit" icon, which offers a quick way to find
and edit content items:
