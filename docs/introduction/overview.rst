The Nature of Kotti
===================

Websites come in so many varieties. Broadly, for the modern World Wide Web,
websites are built using several main development approaches:

* Web browser focus, with the server kept as a simple storage system.
* Server focus, with a robust intelligent database system.
* Combinations that blur these two approaches.

Kotti uses the second approach mainly, but has the flavor of a combined
approach, with the latest browser programming techniques used for parts of the
user interface, and with the programming language Python forming the heart of
the system on the server, backed by a powerful database engine. Kotti forms a
great platform for extending with browser programming of advanced graphics and
presentation features.

As a user, you don't have to know about the languages used, nor the focus on
browser or server programming--you just use the website. However,
understanding the nature of the software will stimulate an appreciation and
confidence in using it.

Design Goals
============

The choices of general approach made by Kotti, and of the software components
used, reflect several design goals:

* Keep the core simple, using a natural design.
* Use and re-use top-quality software components.
* Write code that uses best practices for style and form.
* Work collaboratively, using modern development tools.
* Test the software continuously.

Kotti has marched through numerous revisions to become stable, and a group of
dedicated software developers has assembled. Many of the developers have years
of experience in CMS projects and in the languages used in Kotti. The future
looks bright for the adoption of Kotti for small and large websites, for
internal company systems, for social media, and many other niches. It is a
capable CMS with high potential.

The design of Kotti has content storage as something like an outline or tree,
where content is nested in a meaningful way.  This is the natural design
aspect. The Document content type is the most important part of this concept.
Documents are added to a Kotti website in the way word-processor documents are
created, but in the context of the web. Documents contain text and may include
images, files, and links to other documents.  Kotti's design makes linking
documents to one another happen automatically as the site structure is built.
Plus, there are easy tools to make custom links between content items, or to
other websites. 

Reiterating the centrol role for the Document content type in organization, we
can describe typical use. You add documents for each main part of your website.
You add documents within those. If your site has a deep structure, you add
documents within documents within documents to form a deep nested structure.
Everything else can be considered secondary, for importance in organization,
because you store images, files, and custom content items within documents as
the structure unfolds during site construction. A given document could have its
own textual content, as well as serving as the storage location for the
associated images and files displayed or linked there.
