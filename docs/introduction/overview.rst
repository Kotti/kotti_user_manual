The Nature of Kotti
===================

A website is a website is a website. Not.

For the modern day World Wide Web, websites are built using several main
development approaches, including:

* Web browser focus, with the server kept as a simple storage system.
* Server focus, with a robust database storage system.
* Combinations that blur these two approaches.

Kotti uses the second approach mainly, but has the flavor of a combined
approach, with the latest browser programming techniques used for parts of the
user interface, and with the programming language Python forming the heart of
the system on the server, backed by a powerful database engine.

As a user, you don't have to know about the languages used, nor the focus on
browser or server programming--you just use the website. However,
understanding the nature of the software will help you to appreciate it, to
build confidence in it.

Design Goals
============

The choice of approach made by Kotti, and the software components used, reflect
several design goals:

* Keep the core simple, using a natural design.
* Use and re-use best-of-breed software components.
* Write code that uses best practices for style and form.
* Work collaboratively, using modern development tools.
* Test the software continuously.

Kotti has marched through numerous revisions to become stable, and a group of
dedicated software developers has assembled. Many of the developers have years
of experience in CMS projects and in the languages used in Kotti. The future
looks bright for the adoption of Kotti for small and large websites, for
internal company systems, for social media, and many other niches. It is a
capable CMS with high potential.

The design of Kotti has content storage as something like an outline or tree,
where content is nested in a meaningful way.  This is the natural aspect. The
Document content type is the most important part of this concept. Documents are
added to a Kotti website in the way word-processor documents are created, but
in the context of the web. Documents contain text and may include images,
files, and links to other documents.  Kotti's design makes linking documents to
one another happen automatically as the site structure is built. Plus, there
are easy tools to make custom links between content items, or to other
websites.
