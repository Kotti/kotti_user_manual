Getting Started With a New Site
-------------------------------

Kotti creates a default front page with general information about Kotti itself,
and it adds a single document called "About" that has a photograph of airplanes
and placeholder text.

Both the front page and the "About" page need to be changed for a new website.
Someone may have already set up your site, or you may be part of a larger
organization where you work on just one part of a large site, but as we go
through this user manual, we'll work as if you are starting with your own new
website.

For the website associated with this user manual we will add content for a
fruit stand.  We will replace the default "About" page with information about
the fruit stand offerings and schedule, and we will put introductory
information on the front page. We will add a Document called "Fruits" and to
it we will add images of the fruits for sale.  We will tag the fruit images for
fruit categories to which they belong.  This will be enough to demonstrate
Kotti's main features.

For the first task, let's delete the default "About" page. We are logged in, so
we can see it. Notice that it is in the Private state (left side of screen,
see "Private" in what is called the editor bar, the row of menu choices
underneath the black toolbar):

.. Image:: ../images/default_about.png

.. Note:: You need to be logged in to see Add, Edit, and other forms, and you
          need rights as either the Admin user or a user with a role given Edit
          rights. After logging in, you will see a menu bar at the bottom of
          the site header, with menu choices for Private vs. Public (state),
          View, Contents, Edit, Share, Actions, Add, Navigate. Your username is
          at the far right (We are logged in as Administrator), where there is
          a pull-down menu for setting your personal site preferences. Here is
          the editor bar:

.. Image:: ../images/editor_bar.png

Since we have the "About" page in view, we have certain actions available via
the "Actions" pull-down menu, one of which is "Delete":

.. Image:: ../images/default_about_actions_menu.png

When we click the "Actions" menu, and the "Delete" choice, we get a
confirmation page:

.. Image:: ../images/default_about_delete_confirmation.png

Clicking "Delete" here will permanently delete the "About" page.

.. Image:: ../images/default_about_delete_flash_message.png

The "About" page has been deleted. You no longer see "About" in the toolbar
across the top of the page. 

Adding a New About Page
-----------------------

We will now add a new "About" page for our fruit stand website. We want to add
the "About" page as a top-level document -- from the "root" of the website. We
get ready to add the "About" page by clicking on the name of the website at
upper left. In the default Kotti website, this will say "Yet another Kotti
site." Then we are ready to click the "Add" choice on the editor bar to add a
Document:

.. Image:: ../images/add_about_actions_menu.png

We enter "About" as the title, and two short sentences for the description and
body, and then click the "Save" button:

.. Image:: ../images/add_about_save.png

After saving, Kotti will flash a message saying the save was successful:

.. Image:: ../images/add_about_save_flash_message.png

And now we have our new "About" page.

Editing the Front Page
----------------------

Editing a document is very similar to adding one. We visit the page by clicking
its title whereever we can see it. In the case of the front page, we get there
the same way as above, by clicking on the "Yet another Kotti site" name at
upper left. But now, instead of "Add," we choose "Edit" in the editor bar.

And we select and delete the existing description and body, replacing it with a
bit of information about our fruit stand (Use your mouse and/or keyboard as you
normally would to select text and images and delete, then type new text):

.. Image:: ../images/edit_front_page_save.png

After saving, the front page doesn't have much, but at least it is about our
fruit stand now:

.. Image:: ../images/edit_front_page_save_flash_message.png

And now we are off and running with a new site.
