Workflow Policies
=================

The term used for the setup for user and roles is ``workflow``. A workflow is a
set of policies created for a given CMS setup, wherein user groups and roles
are defined, and relationships and responsibilities are set.  Additional
states, augmenting the default Public and Private, such as Pending, Postponed,
Scheduled, Ready-For-Circulation, Needs-Full-Review, etc., may be added,
depending on specific needs. As these state names suggest, this is an area
where creativity can help to build a fine-grained system.

You do not need to create a workflow policy to use a Kotti website. As user
groups are created manually by the Admin user, a defacto workflow is created.
A saved workflow is only created when there is a need to reuse a given set of
policies.
