Publishing Content
------------------

Recall the two workflow states in the default Kotti website: Private and
Public. All of the content we added to the fruit stand website is in the
Private state. So, if we log out, we don't see anything but the front page:

.. Image:: ../images/not_logged_in.png

We don't see the "About" page, nor any of the rest, because anonymous viewers
can only see Public content. Private content is invisible to them.

We can publish content by changing the state of items from Private to Public by
several methods. The quickest way for single items is to use the pulldown menu
on the left side of the editor bar:

If we log back in and do that for "About," "Featured Fruits," "Fruit
Rootstock," and "Fruits" main content items, and then log back out, we now
can see those content items in anonymous view:
