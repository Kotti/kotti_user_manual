<h1>Images<a class="headerlink" href="#images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are two ways to add images to a Kotti website:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>One way is to add an image to the text of the body of a Document, using the
word processor style interface, whereby the image is placed as a discrete
part of the body of the document. There would be a choice of formatting the
image as a thumbnail size image, or a number of other size choices. The
image could be placed left, right, above, or below the text associated with
it. It could be part of a bullet point, or in a table cell, etc.</li>
<li>Another way is to add an Image directly from the &#8220;Add&#8221; menu.  Adding an
Image via the &#8220;Add&#8221; menu is equivalent, by position, to adding it to the
body of a document. The Image would &#8220;live&#8221; on the website at the position of
the document, but the image would be visible only in the Navigate display of
the website, because it was not added within the text of the body of a
document.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Regardless of how an image is added, it will be stored at the
position of the document to which (method 1) or at which (method 2)
it was added. And you can always see this structure in the &#8220;Navigate&#8221;
display, with images shown indented within the documents with which
they are associated. There is also a way to use method 2 to make a
document show its contents as a list.</p>
</div>
<p>Most often you will want to add images to the body of documents where they are
needed, as you would add images to a word processor document (method 1).
However, the flexibility for adding images as discrete items by position allows
creativity.</p>
<p>We will demonstrate both approaches in this user manual:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>We will add a document called &#8220;Featured Fruits&#8221; and within it another
document called &#8220;Bramley&#8217;s Seedling&#8221; to showcase a type of apple. We&#8217;ll add
some text to the body of the &#8220;Bramley&#8217;s Seedling&#8221; document, about the
interesting history of this tree, and will add there also an image showing a
picture of the original Bramley&#8217;s tree, planted by a little girl in 1809.</li>
<li>We will add a document called &#8220;Fruits&#8221; and will add images via the &#8220;Add&#8221;
menu there. We will set the default view of the document to be &#8220;Folder View&#8221;
to get an easy list of all the fruit images. The default view setting is in
the Actions menu.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="method-1-adding-an-image-to-a-document-body">
<h2>Method 1: Adding an Image to a Document Body<a class="headerlink" href="#method-1-adding-an-image-to-a-document-body" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you are adding or editing a document, you have the word-processor-like
panel of icons to change the styling of text, to format paragraphs, add links,
etc. One of these icons is the image icon, the one that features a tree. To add
an image at some place in text you have types in the body, click or move the
cursor to the spot where you want it. Usually this is at the beginning or end
of a paragraph, or on a line by itself. Then click the image icon to show the
image editing popup window to either paste the URL of the image, if it is
available on some website, or to browse your computer for an image to upload.
There are text entry fields for adding title and a description (sometimes
called &#8220;alt&#8221; text for an image).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s add the image of the Bramley&#8217;s Seedling tree, planted in 1809, to a
document about the tree. Here you see where we are adding a document called
&#8220;Bramley&#8217;s Seedling&#8221; to &#8220;Featured Fruits&#8221;, which had already been added. We
have typed text describing the history of the tree, and are now ready to add
the image.</p>
<img alt="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document.png" src="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document.png" />
<p>At this point, after entering the body text, the cursor is at the end of the
text.  We now click the image icon, which shows the image editing window, into
which we enter the title and description of the image, and we browse to find
the image file on our computer:</p>
<img alt="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document_image_dialog.png" src="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document_image_dialog.png" />
<p>After clicking the &#8220;Insert&#8221; button, we see the image as it appears within the
body text:</p>
<img alt="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document_image_in_body.png" src="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document_image_in_body.png" />
<p>To finish, we save the &#8220;Bramley&#8217;s Seedling&#8221; document:</p>
<img alt="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document_image_saved.png" src="../_images/adding_bramleys_seedling_document_image_saved.png" />

<h2>Image Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#image-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is more to the Image content type. Images can be made from photographs,
from scanned documents, from frame grabs of video, from screen captures, from
the output of specialized programs &#8211; so many ways. But they mostly fall into a
set of familar types, with filename endings like .jpg, .png, and .gif. They
vary in size tremendously, from thumbnail images only a few kilobytes in size
to the real whoppers, the ones coming off modern digital cameras, even
point-and-shoot cameras. These can be many megabytes in size, and in dimension,
thousands of pixels wide and tall.</p>
<p>Kotti helps make sense of all of this. Websites don&#8217;t need huge-size images for
normal display, although large images can certainly be stored on a website.  A
typical website is 1000 pixels wide or so, giving you a good idea of the
largest size you will need.</p>
<p>The most common routine goes something like this. You take some photographs and
download them from your camera to your computer. You look at them, delete the
bad ones, keep the good, make adjustments to improve the contrast, brightness,
etc. Some photographs you select for use on your website.  At this point, you
should follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Don&#8217;t upload them to the website as the original huge images.</li>
<li>Resize them first. Find the &#8220;export&#8221; or &#8220;save as&#8221; or &#8220;share&#8221; part of your
image editing / photo viewing software. Save the photographs on your computer
as 1200 pixels in width before uploading, or upload them as they are if they
are less than 1200 pixels wide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon uploading to a Kotti website, there is behind-the-scenes work for
preparing copies of the original image at several sizes that fit the design of
the website.  In the old days of the web, and in unsophisticated systems, you
would have to manually do this work.</p>
<p>An image is given a title and description when you add it. Just as web
addresses (URLs) are made for documents, the image will have its own URL.
Consider a photograph you have on your computer named IMG_5381.jpg. That is the
name that your camera gave it. Imagine it is a picture of a particular variety
of apple, Bramley&#8217;s Seedling.  When you add the photograph to your website, you
would give it a good title and description.</p>
<p>After the IMG_5381.jpg image has been uploaded, it is available as:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="28%" />
<col width="72%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Image Title</th>
<th class="head">URL (name is last part)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>Bramley&#8217;s Seedling</td>
<td>www.example.com/featured_fruits/bramleys-seedling</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The name of files on your computer, such as IMG_5381.jpg, is usually not needed
in the context of a website.  A good approach is to label images in your
desktop computer software, as with &#8220;Bramley&#8217;s Seedling&#8221;, so that when you
upload them to your website, or change something later, you can identify items.
Consider working on your website after a year has passed, and you decide to
crop the &#8220;Bramley&#8217;s Seedling&#8221; image to a closer crop to the apple.  Where is
the original image on your computer? Find the original file, IMG_5381.jpg by
the title, used also as the image label or caption on your computer.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There is no avoiding the need for this kind of management. Try to
develop good habits.</p>
</div>
<p>The image URL shows its context on the website. It lives within
/featured_fruits. If you want to see the image all by itself, add /image on the
end of the URL:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">featured_fruits</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bramleys</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">seedling</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">image</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Visiting this URL would show the full-size image that you uploaded.</p>

<h2>Image Sizes<a class="headerlink" href="#image-sizes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kotti uses a modern approach for layout, and it knows the default widths of the
entire site, and of its parts. The behind-the-scenes preparation work described
above, that Kotti does to prepare images automatically at different sizes,
takes this layout knowledge into account. This results in the following
additional available image URLs, along with their widths:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="83%" />
<col width="17%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">

<p>Use these sizes a general guideline for working with the Kotti layout system.
You know that span12 covers the entire width of the website, span6 half of it.
span1, at only 60 pixels wide, is small thumbnail size.</p>
<p>The structural layout for a Kotti website is divided into 12 columns.  The
default Kotti website uses a full-width design, so you see no indication of the
columns. If the design of the website is changed, however, as when a navigation
menu is added on the left side, the underlying column structure manifests. The
navigation menu might span 3 columns, leaving 9 columns for the right-hand
side, where content items show.  The image scale that fits such a navigation
menu area on the left, 3 columns wide, is span3. The one that fits the right
side in such a layout is span9.  This scheme makes working with website layout
simpler than thinking in terms of absolute pixel dimensions.</p>
<p>The word-processor style user interface for composing the body of a document
has an image picker that pops up when you click the image button. You can
simply pick the image scale you want from a list, and experiment until you find
an image scale that works for a given need.</p>
<p>Images do not have to fit flush to column widths in a design layout. In the
example above, in the area on the right that is 9 columns wide, you many want
to use a medium-size image, centered at the top. The span5 image scale would
work nicely for that. Or you might want to use a span2 thumbnail in a
paragraph.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Learning about Kotti&#8217;s treatment of images helps you appreciate how
Kotti is able to scale down from a full computer display to show the
website on a tablet, or on a phone. It changes the size definitions
of the spans dynamically, so that the site stays proportional, within
reason, at different overall sizes.  The span system for design
layout avoids hard-coding to set sizes.</p>
