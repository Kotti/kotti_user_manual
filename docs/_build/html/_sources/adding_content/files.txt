Files
=====

Files are files that you create store on your computer, but for one reason or
another, wish to post on your website. One common need is to post PDF files,
perhaps for a newsletter or brochure. Another is to post word processor files
to share. You don't edit these files with Kotti, but you can add them anywhere,
and you can link to them from documents.

Images are not Files, per se, in the context of Kotti -- they have their own
content type.
