Searching Tags
==============

In the normal view for content items, if you click a tag, the entire website
will be searched for items that have been tagged with the clicked tag.

You can also find content with certain tags by entering search terms into the
general search field in the header of the site. If a tag is titled 'British
cars', a search for either 'British cars' exactly, 'British', or 'cars' will
find any items with the tag.
